# ABOUND Starter Repo - Processing

TODO:

- Copy over all the docs from another repo
- Figure out how to read from environment variables or provide a shim of some kind
- Reference https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Running-without-a-Display in Dockerfile
- Consider disentangling harness from algo lib
